# Summary
Goal of this document is for front-end developers to look up what would be the preferred solution for a given problem.  
It is merely a collection of problems and potential solutions.  
This document should also serve as a good way to navigate trough these solutions.  

The information in this repo should allow developer to:

- Find within reasonable time if this repo contains solution to the problem
- Judge if the information is applicable for the encountered problem
- Understand why the solution is preferred over other solutions
- Implement the solution described in this repository
- Judge if the information is outdated
- See where the information is coming from

# What to Contribute
Developers may contribute to this document via pull request.  
Always be critical when to add more content.
Searching in this document can also cost time.  
When the answer to your question was found by a 1 minute google search it may not be a good problem to add here.  
For problems and solutions to add to this repository at least one of the following is true:

- Took considerable amount of time to look up through other channels (google, stack-overflow, other repo's)
- Looking it up took more knowledge about the problem then would be considered normal for a junior developer.
- It is difficult to select the right answer from a pile of not so good answers that pop up through google or stack-overflow
- The answer might be different because of our specific domain, architecture, app, customer etcetera.

# Contribute Format

- Title: descriptive title
- Tags: Will later be used for search engine.
- date (things may outdate fast, it is good to see when it was last touched. Is this needed with git though?) 
- the source, could be stack overflow answer, forum,  blog, github repo, book, or your own brains.  
  * Also copy the relevant section, since links may rot
- explanation why this is the best approach. Could be copy pasted from source, but be critical.
  * advantages
  * disadvantages
- Code snippets and README.md in its own folder within this repository's ./code folder. See Example Contribution header.
- A link to the README.md file in the code sippet's folder. Add link under relevant header under Content.
- Relation to our own architecture. Someone might argue that sass object extension is best but we do not have set up sass. So for us it might be a huge extra overhead
- Optional: Emerging technologies that may change the answer. Keep it short
- Optional: Alternatives and when they should be considered. Depending on relevance keep it short.

I also find it hardest to find good answers online.
